# Home Price Prediction using Regression

The project is aimed at creating an simple Random Forest  regression based model starting from data import of training data to data exploration of the data to data cleaning using statistical analysis and preparing the dataset for the final data and using feature engineering to help in developing the model using linear and random forest regression and further increasing the model accuracy using technique called as RandomizedSearchCV
